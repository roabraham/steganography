# Simple Image Steganography

This web application provides a simple way for effective image _steganography_ designed to hide larger amount of data in an image file by replacing an entire _color component_ of the _carrier image_ instead of a few bits so you can hide much more data than a simple message. On the con, this method is much weaker than the traditional image steganorgaphy so you should choose a carrier image with a strong _dominant color palette_ and hide the data by replacing the _weakest color component_ to make this steganography less noticable. _If it is essential to hide your data properly, you should choose a different steganography tool_ as this module was designed to hide large amount of data instead of hiding data deep in the carrier image to make finding the data nearly impossible.

## Requirements

To install this web application, you need a _web server_ supporting **PHP 5.4** or later with PHP's **GD extension**.

## Installation

Place this entire repository (except the `release` subdirectory) somewhere in your web server's document _root directory_. A subdirectory should also work.

## Usage

Once the web application is installed on your web server, navigate to `index.html` and follow the instructions in your web browser. To use the application on large files (at least 10 MB but it actually depends on the performance of your system) you may have to adjust the limitations defined in `include/convert.php` file and in your `php.ini` file.

A _desktop version_ (powered by [PHP Desktop](https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop)) is also available in the `release` subdirectory. For desktop use, **Microsoft Windows XP SP3** or later is required.

## Embedding PHP steganography class in a different web application

To _embed PHP steganography class_ in a separate web application, place `include/class.php_stego.php` file in your web application and include the class in the corresponding script as you can see bellow:

```php
require_once 'class.php_stego.php';
...
$php_stego = new PHP_STEGO();
//if $bin_to_image = 1, binary data fill be converted to an image
//binary data will be extracted from the image otherwise
$php_stego->set_encoding_direction($bin_to_image);
$php_stego->set_carrier_data($carrier_image_data);
$php_stego->set_input_data($binary_data_to_encode);
$php_stego->set_encryption_key('Your Password');
$output_image_data = $php_stego->convert();
```

To extract the encoded binary data, do the following:

```php
...
$php_stego->set_input_data($output_image_data);
$php_stego->set_encoding_direction(false);
$output_file = $php_stego->convert();
```

For further information on how to use the class, check `include/convert.php` script.
